## Project

For this project you will be creating an API using a test driven development approach as well as writing documentation.  As an example of good documentation you can reference GitHub's API docs: https://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/

For this project you will be building a simple restful API for a database with collections of your choosing.

## Requirements

1. Your API must have routes that use the following HTTP verbs: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
2. You must have documentation for each route.  Write your documentation in a file called `documentation.md`.
3. You must have at least one test written for each route.  Write your tests BEFORE you write the actual routes.
4. Your models should have some methods/statics that are tested.
5. You will need to have tests for your routes and for your models.
