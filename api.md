# AWESOME DOCUMENTATION AND TESTING FOR AN AMAZING C.R.U.D. API & SERVER
## REST API v1 OVERVIEW
> a simple RESTful API for a database with collections of your choosing.

**C.R.U.D.** = Create Read Update Destroy
**RE.S.T.**  = REpresentational State Transfer
**A.P.I.**   = Application Programming Interface


1. Starting with the basic Food database example which Ben demonstrated in his [lecture](https://youtu.be/otSW2ZpBa2U).
2. Add a "reaction"

### TESTING
> at least one test written for each route.

> Write your tests BEFORE you write the actual routes.

1. mocha, chai sinon
  - Some adjustments per deprecation warnings.
  - set up for `npm run watch`.
  - not sure if this will cause problems for future test scenarios where db needs to be persistent?
  ```js
  mongoose.models = {};
  mongoose.modelSchemas = {};
  ```

  - also configured for mongoose vs. Promises.
  ```js
  mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
  ```

2. TBD: configure with jest?

> need to have tests for your routes and for your models.

### SCHEMA
> models should have some methods/statics that are tested.

### ROUTES
> routes that use the following HTTP verbs: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
